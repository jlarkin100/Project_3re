Jamie Larkin and Jesutobi Onigbogi. This system represents the different settings that windshield wipers can be set to while a car is running. We started off by turning the car on and with the wipers initially set to off. We then tried out different settings (high-speed and low-speed) and when we got to the intermittent setting we adjusted the time delay in between each cycle. Throughout the demonstration of this system, the readings on the LCD screen told us the setting of the wipers, and, when applicable, the time delay. The table below shows the goals that the project was expected to complete, and the comments addressed how consistently they met requirements. 

Ignition Subsystem 




Specification

Windshield wiper subsystem




The wipers do not work if the engine is not running. 
Pass


The wipers run on all modes with all the typical parameter values.
Pass
The delays are followed for INT mode and RPMâ€™s followed for hi and lo. (30 and 40)
When the mode is set to INT, the desired delay is displayed on the screen. 
Pass


The selected mode and selected time delay is displayed on the screen. 
Pass/Fail
This does work, however the screen is often delayed when switching from mode to mode.
If the wipers are turned off/ the car is turned off while completing a cycle, they will finish the cycle and return to 0 degrees. 
Pass


If the wiper is hesitating in INT mode, it remains stationary.
